We can help you write your own <br>
SUCCESS STORY!!

	The CITIZEN to CITIZEN PROJECT is a NOT-for-PROFIT Kickstarter that seeks to maximize the success of formally incarcerated individuals returning to their communities. Through proven re-entry support models, combined with locating the necessary resources and service benefits that will assure the smoothest and most successful transition possible for each of our clients.
<br>
<br>
<br>
    We wholeheartedly believe that ONLY someone who has been justice involved in some capacity or formally incarcerated, can accurately sympathize and fully understand exactly what it takes to successfully reintegrate back into the community.	

<br>
<br>
<br>
   As such, The CITIZEN to CITIZEN PROJECT employs ONLY formally incarcerated or justice impacted individuals that share in our vision of not just reducing recidivism, but also ensuring each of our clients is successful by identifying exactly what each client needs to triumphantly navigate their future.
<br>
<br>

   We at C2C feel that we are in a unique position to welcome and guide returning citizens back to their communities because we have already walked down the road they are about to embark.  
   <br>
   <br>
   We know what works and what doesnâ€™t work, we've been there!! 
   <br>
   <br>
   We also fully understand what it feels like to not be seen as an equal citizen and are committed to breaking that stigma within our society.
